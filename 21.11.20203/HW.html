    <h1>White House begins early planning for 6G development</h1>
    <div>
      <p>
        The White House plans to meet on Friday with government officials,
        business leaders and members of the academic community to discuss
        strategies for building out next-generation 6G wireless technology and
        lessons learned from the rollout of 5G.
      </p>
      <p>
        The 6G technology is almost certainly years away, but the
        administration’s effort is likely part of a bid to beat China and
        re-establish the US as a leader in wireless connectivity, as well as to
        carefully plan for new technologies that will be essential to national
        security and the broader economy.

        “It’s imperative that we start to look at these issues early,” a
        security official for the Biden administration said during a press call
        on Thursday evening.

        The White House wants to “take the lessons learned from 5G about the
        importance of early involvement and resilience,” the official said, and
        apply that to developing a 6G network that “optimizes performance,
        accessibility, and security.”
      </p>
      <p>
        Compared to 4G, the new 5G technology promised significantly enhanced
        performance in terms of speeds, reliability and zero lag time, opening
        the door to everything from new surgical procedures and safer
        transportation to more immersive video games.
      </p>
      <p>
        Although the 5G infrastructure rollout in the US is mostly complete —
        the final few carriers launched their 5G services in 2022 — consumer
        adoption still lags behind 4G in the country. ABI Research forecasts
        that by the end of 2023, more than 270 million subscribers will use 4G
        connectivity, compared to just over 170 million 5G subscribers.
