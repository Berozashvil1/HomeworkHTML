    <h1>White House begins early planning for 6G development</h1>
    <div>
      <p>
        The White House plans to meet on Friday with government officials,
        business leaders and members of the academic community to discuss
        strategies for building out next-generation 6G wireless technology and
        lessons learned from the rollout of 5G.
      </p>
      <p>
        The 6G technology is almost certainly years away, but the
        administration’s effort is likely part of a bid to beat China and
        re-establish the US as a leader in wireless connectivity, as well as to
        carefully plan for new technologies that will be essential to national
        security and the broader economy.
      </p>
      <p>
        “It’s imperative that we start to look at these issues early,” a
        security official for the Biden administration said during a press call
        on Thursday evening.

        The White House wants to “take the lessons learned from 5G about the
        importance of early involvement and resilience,” the official said, and
        apply that to developing a 6G network that “optimizes performance,
        accessibility, and security.”
      </p>
      <p>
        Compared to 4G, the new 5G technology promised significantly enhanced
        performance in terms of speeds, reliability and zero lag time, opening
        the door to everything from new surgical procedures and safer
        transportation to more immersive video games.
      </p>
      <p>
        Although the 5G infrastructure rollout in the US is mostly complete —
        the final few carriers launched their 5G services in 2022 — consumer
        adoption still lags behind 4G in the country. ABI Research forecasts
        that by the end of 2023, more than 270 million subscribers will use 4G
        connectivity, compared to just over 170 million 5G subscribers.

        Some countries, including China, have found more traction. However,
        conditions in China are not directly comparable to those in the US, as
        the Chinese government has much more influence over business decisions,
        according to Leo Gergs, an analyst at ABI Research. The more limited 5G
        adoption in the US can also be attributed to the fact that 5G network
        infrastructure developed slower than expected, Gergs said. As a result,
        5G networks are less potent and consumers may see less incentive to pay
        a premium for 5G connectivity.
      </p>
      <p>
        “For consumers the performance of 4G connectivity is good enough, so
        that they are less willing to pay an additional fee for the low
        latencies or faster data rates that 5G promises to consumers,” Gergs
        said. It’s unclear what 6G will look like. The administration said it
        expects that by combining elements such as AI, advanced software, cloud
        computing and cutting-edge semiconductor chips, it can create faster
        networks to support applications in health, energy, transportation,
        water and agriculture.
